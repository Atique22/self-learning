# problem-solving

A collection of problem-solving functions in Go.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This function calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number `n` and returns the sequence as an array or slice.

## Prime Numbers

This function determines whether a given number `n` is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

## Palindrome Check

The palindrome check function determines whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Reverse String

The reverse string function reverses a given string without using the built-in reverse function. It swaps the characters from the start and end of the string until the entire string is reversed.

## Number Sequence

The number sequence function generates various number sequences based on user input. It currently supports the following types of sequences:

- Fibonacci Sequence
- Prime Numbers
- Palindrome Numbers
- Square Numbers
- Cube Numbers

## Factorial

The factorial function calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

## Find Duplicates

The find duplicates function finds and returns any duplicates in a given array or slice. It scans through the elements and identifies any values that occur more than once.

## Binary Search

The binary search algorithm searches for a given target value in a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.

## Anagram Check

The anagram check function checks whether two given strings are anagrams. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

## Word Count

The word count function counts the occurrence of each word in a given string and returns the word count as a map. It splits the string into words and counts their frequencies.

## Matrix Operations

The matrix operations functions perform basic matrix operations such as matrix addition, multiplication, and transposition. These operations are useful in linear algebra and numerical computations.
